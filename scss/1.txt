    list-style: none;
  }
  li { display: inline-block; }
  a {

    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}

// _reset.scss
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

// main.scss
@import 'reset';
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

4)what is mixins and @include??

Let you create reusable chunks of CSS that you can include in other selectors.
scss
Copy code
@mixin border-radius($radius) {
  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
     -moz-border-radius: $radius;
      -ms-border-radius: $radius;
          border-radius: $radius;
}

.box { @include border-radius(10px); }

Allows selectors to inherit all the styles of another selector.
scss

.message {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

.success {
  @extend .message;
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  @extend .message;
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  @extend .message;
  border-color: yellow;

6)Operators??
SCSS supports standard mathematical operators, allowing you to perform calculations directly within your stylesheets.
scss
Copy code
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

.sidebar {
  width: 300px;
}

.main {
  width: calc(100% - 300px);
}


7)functions??
SCSS includes built-in functions for manipulating colors, numbers, strings, and more. You can also define your own functions.
scss
Copy code
@function em($px, $base: 16px) {
  @return ($px / $base) * 1em;
}

.container {
  font-size: em(24px);
}
Control Directives and Expressions:

SCSS includes features like @if, @for, @each, and @while that allow you to use logic and loops within your stylesheets.
scss
Copy code
@for $i from 1 through 3 {
  .col-#{$i} { width: 100% / 3 * $i; }
}

@each $color in red, green, blue {
  .#{$color}-text { color: $color; }
}
These features make SCSS a powerful tool for developers to write more maintainable, reusable, and readable CSS.
