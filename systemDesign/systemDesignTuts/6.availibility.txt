availability of application:-
suppose btech result are come appliction are  down

monolithic application server are more down becase all resources are deployed in one server

microservice application server are not down becase all resources are deployed on multiple server and replica to multiple machiine

How to increase availability??
1)Replication
2)distributed
3)Redundancy

=>Replication vs Redundancy
Replication: synchronize with duplication of node(server data)
Redundancy: copying of node(server data)
