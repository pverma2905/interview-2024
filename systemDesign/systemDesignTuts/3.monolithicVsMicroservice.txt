Differnce b/w monolithic and microservice??

monolithic:-
1)same code base and deploy at one place
2)single point of failure


microservice:-
1)backened
2)fronteed
3)database 

1)differnt code base and deploy each differnt places
2)it is distributed (so single point of failure)

distributed application code is removed for backup replica is there

advantage:-
1)horizontally scalable := add more machine  like ec2
2)No spof
3)low latency: add more cpu

disadvantage:-
1)complexity
2)mangement required
3)difficult to secure
4)message may be lost in b/w server
