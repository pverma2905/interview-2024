meta tags are used to provide metadata about the HTML document, such as the character set, author, or description. They are placed in the <head> section.
=>Character Encoding:
Specifies the character set used in the document. For example, UTF-8 is commonly used.
<meta charset="UTF-8">
=>Viewport Settings (Responsive Design):
Controls the layout on mobile devices to ensure proper scaling and responsiveness.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
=>Page Description:
Describes the content of the page. Search engines use this in search results.
<meta name="description" content="This is a description of the page content.">
=>Keywords (SEO):
Provides keywords related to the page content, though it is less used by search engines today.
=>Content-Type:
Defines the MIME type of the document. For example, ensuring the page is displayed as HTML
=>Author Information:
Specifies the author of the document.



<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="description" content="Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with tutorials and examples.">
   <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Development">
   <meta name="author" content="John Doe">

</head>



7)new feature of html5??
New semantic elements like <article>, <section>, <header>, and <footer>.
New form controls such as <input type="email">, <input type="date">, <input type="range">, etc.
Multimedia support with <audio> and <video> tags.
Local storage (localStorage and sessionStorage).
Canvas and SVG support for drawing graphics.
Geolocation API, Web Workers, WebSockets.

8)What is the canvas element in HTML5?
The <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, such as lines, shapes, and images, on a web page via JavaScript. It provides a resolution-dependent, bitmap canvas for creating interactive or animated graphics.

9)What is the difference between SVG and Canvas in HTML5?
Canvas: A resolution-dependent, pixel-based drawing surface. It is good for complex, high-performance graphics like games but doesn’t support DOM manipulation.
=>it is resolution dependent
=>doesn’t support DOM manipulation 

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): A vector-based graphics format that is resolution-independent and allows for DOM interaction and CSS styling. It’s better for applications requiring scalability and interactivity.
=>it is resolution independent
=>support DOM manipulation 

10) Explain the new API features introduced in HTML5.
Geolocation API: Retrieves the geographical location of the user.
Drag-and-Drop API: Enables elements to be draggable on the web page.
WebSockets: Provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time data exchange.
History API: Allows manipulation of the browser session history.

defer: Ensures the script will be executed only after the entire HTML document is parsed, and it maintains the order of scripts.
async: Scripts are downloaded in parallel and executed as soon as they are available, without waiting for the HTML to finish parsing.

12)what is web worker??
A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.
used:=
Complex mathematical calculations or algorithms (e.g., cryptography, machine learning).
Handling large data sets or files (e.g., parsing large JSON files, processing images).
Real-time data analysis, such as gaming or financial applications.
Background synchronization or continuous polling of data from a server.
