1)Data binding: 
it is 4 type 
a)interpolation
b)eventBinding
c)propertyBinding
d)two way binding

2)differnce b/w property binding and interpollation?
When input is not a string we use property binding.because interpolation convert each input to string
*ngFor loop not use property binding to show the listing

3)What is directive in angular?
By using the dom we can manipulate the dom layout
In Angular there is a 3 type of directive
a)component
b)attribute-(ngStyle,ngClass)(Change the appearance and behavior of an element)
c)structural (*ngIF, *ngFor,*ngSwitch)(change the dom layout by adding and removing the dom element )

4)@input decorator?
Pass data from parent to child component

5)@output decorator?
Pass data from child to parent component

6)pipes?
Pipes is transform data to desired output before display
Two type of pipes are there
a)Custom pipe
b)built in pipe

7)BuiltInPipe?
a)upperCase
b)lowerCase
c)titleCase
d)date
e)currency
f)percent
g)number
h)slice
i)Json
j)Async

8)Route Guard?
Router guards are interfaces which tell to the router whether to allow the navigation or not 
If guard return true navigation work and if false navigation is cancel

9) type of guards?
a)canActivate->before visiting the route.it check route is access or not
b)canActivateChild->it check child route is visited or not
c)candeactivate-> before leaving the route it check permission
d)resolve->until the data is not resolve route will wait 
e)CanLoad->it check the route is lazy loaded or not
f)can match->

10)angular module?

Benefit of modules->
1)code Maintainibility(loosely coupled)
2)scalibility
3)lazyloading
4)abstraction

By default Angular module are eagerly load->means when application load all modules is load

11)Loading Stategy?
a) pre loading
b)lazy loading
c)eager loading

12)lazy loading?
It load javascript component asynchronously
It improve the speed of application loading time by splitting the application in several bundle

13)promises and observable?
Handling asynchronous operation handle in angular using promises and Observable 

Promise:
It is eager
Promise emit single value
Not apply any operator
Not cancel the promise

Observable:-
Observable is lazy
Observable emit multiple value
Many operator  we apply on observable
But we cancel the Observable

14)Subject vs Observable??
a)Subject are multicast->it return same data for multiple subscriber(same api call two times for multiple subscriber)
b)Subject are hot
 
a)Observable are unicast->it return different data for multiple subscriber(same  api call for one time for multiple subscriber)
b)Observable are cold 

15) Subject Vs BehaviourSubject?
Subject does not hold a value
When we subscribe subject it not emit any value
After next() we try to subscribe not get any value

Behavior subject hold a value and when subscribe it emit a value
When we subscribe a behaviourSubject it emit  value
After next() we try to subscribe  get value

16) Behaviour Subject Vs ReplySubject?
BehaviourSubject->
It hold the initial value
It emit the old value to new subscriber

Reply Subject->
It does not hold any initial value
It emit the last value

17)async Subject->
1)last value of the observable execution sent to its subscriber only when execution complete
