1)What are Component life cycle phases?
=>mounting phases=> this phase occur when an instance of a component is created and insert into the dom
=>updating phases=>this phase occur when a component is being rendered as a result of changes either is prop or state 
=>unmounting Phases=> this phase occur when a component is removed fron the dom 

2)What are Component life cycle methods?
=>Mounting phase:-
constructor()
getDrivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()

=>updating Phase:-
getDrivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapShotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()

=>unmounting:-
componentWillUnmount()


3)What are Constructors in class components? When to use them?
=>constructor is a special method that is called when instance of the created
=>constructor is used to initilize the component state or performing any setup that is needed before the componentis rendered



4)What is the role of super keyword in constructor?
super keyword is used in the constructor of a class component to call the constructor of the  parent class

this is necessary to ensure the initilization  logic ofthe parent class is executed 

5)What is the role of render() method in component life cycle?
render() method return the react element that will be rendered to the dom

6)How the State can be maintained in a class component?
two step process to maintain state:-
this.setState() method is used to update the state

this.state property is  used to render the updated state in dom

7)What is the role of componentDidMount() method in component life cycle?
componentDidMount() life cycle method in react is the part of mounting phase and it  is  called after the component is being rendered to the dom

Mostly used for side effect
ex:-fetching or setting up the subscription
