1)What are Controlled Components in React?
A controlled componentis a component whose form element (like input field or  checkbox) are controlled by the state of the application 

2)What are the Differences btw Controlled & Uncontrolled Components?
Controlled component:-
value are controlled by react.state 
event handler update react state
Don't depend on useRef()
Redender on state changes
A recommended and standard paractice for form handling in react 

uncontrolled component:-
value are not controlled by react.state
no explicit state update; value  can be accessed directly from the dom
commonly uses useRef() to access from element values
less rerendering since values are not directly tied to react state
useful in certain scenarios but less commonly considered a best practice  

3)What are characteristics of controlled components?
=>state control:- value of the form element is stored in the component state
=>event handling:- change of the form element trigger an event (eg:- on change for input field) 
=>state Update:-event handler update the component state with the new value of the form element 
=>Re-rendering:-the component rerender ith the update state and the form elementreflect the new value   

4)What are the advantages of using controlled components in React forms?
=>in react component form element have their values managed by react state ensuring a single source of truth

=>this approach faciltates predicatable and synchronized updates make it easier to implement the feature such as form validation and dynamic redering and seamless integration react with react lifecycle methods

=>controlled components offer better control and maintainability compared to uncontrolled component make the best practice  handling form in react

5)How to handle forms in React?
the preffered and recommended apprach for handling formin react by using controlled components 

6)How can you handle multiple input fields in a controlled form?
Maintain seprate state variablefor each input field and update them individually using the onchange event

7)How do you handle form validation in a controlled component?
By using conditional rendering based on the state and validate input value before updating state

8)In what scenarios might using uncontrolled components be advantageous?
Uncontrolled components can be benifial when integrating with non react libraries  or dealing  with forms ehen controlled components are not possible
