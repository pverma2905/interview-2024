1)What is the role of useContext() hook?
useContext in react provider a way to pass data from parent to child component without using props

code:-
import {createContext} from "react"
const MyContext = createContext();
export default MyContext

const Parent = ()=>{
    const contextValue= "Hello From Context"
    <MyContext.Provider>
        <child></child>
    </MyContext.Provider>
}

const Child = ()=>{
    const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);
    return <p>{contextValue}</p>
}

2)What is createContext() method? What are Provider & Consumer properties?
=>createContext() function return an object with provider and consumer
=>provider property is responsible for providing the context value to all its childcomponent 
=>useContext() method or consumer property can be used to consume the context value in child component

3)When to use useContext() hook instead of props in real applications?
useContext instead of props when u want to avoid prop drilling and access the context value directly with in deeply nested components   

4)What are the similarities between useState() and useReducer() hook?
❖ 3 Similarities between useState() and useReducer() hook:
1. Both hooks provide a way to update state and trigger a re-render of the component.
2. Both useState and useReducer return an array with two elements:
a. First element is current state
b. Second element is a function that can be used to update the state.


5)What is useReducer() hook? When to use useState() and when useReducer()?
❖ useReducer() is an alternative to the
useState() hook when dealing with
complex state in your components. 


6)What are the differences between useState() and useReducer() Hook?
useState:-
1. useState is simpler to use and used for managing simple state values.
2. It is suitable for managing a single piece of state.
3. The useState hook takes an initial state as an argument and returns an array with two
elements: the current state and a function to update the state.

useReducer:-
1.useReducer is more appropriate for complex state logic or when the next state depends on the previous one.
2.It is well-suited for managing multiple pieces of state that needs to be updated together
3.The useReducer hook takes a reducer function and an initial state as arguments and returns the current state and a dispatch function.


7)What are dispatch & reducer function in useReducer Hook?
❖ dispatch function is returned by the useReducer
hook, and it is used to dispatch actions(type) to
reducer function that trigger state updates.
❖ The reducer function is a function responsible for
updating the state based on the action received
from dispatch function.


8)What is the purpose of passing initial state as an object in UseReducer?
❖ By setting initial state as an object, you can manage complex states with useReducer functions.
