1)What is the difference between Regular Action creator & Thunk action creator?
❖ A regular action creator returns a plain JavaScript object with a type property,
describing the type of action to be performed.
❖ 3 main points about Thunks:
1. A Thunk action creator is a function that returns another function.
2. This returned function dispatched to the Redux store.
3. Thunks are used to handle complex asynchronous operations, such as data fetching or API calls, based on which the action will be decide.

2)Explain the concept of Middleware in React-Redux?
❖ Middleware provides a mechanism to add extra functionality to the Redux store.
❖ Middleware can intercept actions, modify them, or execute additional logic in actions before they reach the reducers.

3)How can you handle Asynchronous Operations & side-effect in React-Redux?
❖ Use middleware and Redux Thunk action creators to handle asynchronous operations.

4)How does Error Handling work in Redux?
❖ Error handling in Redux can be done by using try-catch blocks in action creator, middleware and reducers.

5)What is the difference between Flux & Redux?
❖ Flux is an architecture pattern. It provides a set of design principles for organizing code to manage state in a unidirectional data flow.
❖ Redux is a library that implements the Flux architecture.
