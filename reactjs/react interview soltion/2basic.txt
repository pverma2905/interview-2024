=>React depend on external libraries formany complex feature so developer has to writemany line of code for complex functionality 
=>React is simple to learn and more popular than angular

Angular:-
=>it is Framework
=>it is use a real dom

=>More complex, ES6 class syntax
=>it performance slightly slow
=>Harder due to ‘this’ keyword and complex syntax

state:-
State changes can be asynchronous.
State is mutable.
State holds information about the components.
State cannot be accessed by child components.
