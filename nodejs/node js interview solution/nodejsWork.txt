/////////////////////////////// step of nodejs working ////////////////////////////////////////

blocking- synchronous
non-blocking- asynchronous



step 1:All request are goes in event queue
step 2:event loop always checking event queue
step 3:event queque pick a request and check this request is blocking or non blocking
step 4: if it is non-blocking so it execute give the response to the user
step 5: if it is blocking operation. it goes to the thread pool and thread pool working thread free so working thread is executing the blocking operation

By default it have 4 working thread

so always try to write a non- blocking operation


we can increase the size of thread depend on cpu if it s 8 core cpu to its 8
console.log(os.cpus().length)
