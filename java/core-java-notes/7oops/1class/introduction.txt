=>oops->obect oriented programing structure/system --- c++/ java/ python/ C#

=>c/cobol is follow procedure oriented programing language

=>program is a set of instruction

oop under 4 concept:-

1)inheritence:-code reusibility
2)polymorphism:-differnt behaviour acheive kar sakte hai with same function name
3)abstraction:- code security
4)encapsulation:- data security

1)what is class??
class is template or blueprint from which object are created
ex- Animal
dog is the object of animal 

=>class is a logical entity, class does not represent real world entity

=>class does not required memeory by using class keyword we can create class

=>class is a referenced/non primitive data type 

=>class having variable, methods, constructor and block



2)what is object??
object is a instance/element of class
object is a real world entity/physical existence
object required memory
we can access the class functionality(variable,method, block,constructor) by using object 

How to create object??
ex:- ClassName refrenceVariable = new ClassName();

// refrenceVariable = it will store the address of object/ we can access the property of object
// new -> it is keyword which is reponsible to assign memory to an object
