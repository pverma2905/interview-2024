1)float
Normally div elements will be displayed on top of each other. However, 
if we use float: left we can let elements float next to each other:

left - The element floats to the left of its container
right - The element floats to the right of its container
none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent

2)clear
When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.

The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.

The clear property can have one of the following values:

none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent

3)clearfix:
If a floated element is taller than the containing element, it will "overflow" outside of its 
container. We can then add a clearfix hack to solve this problem:
